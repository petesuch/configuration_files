##   This is a mini Arch Linux installation howto -- reference:
##  "ArchLinux Installation Wiki"
##  Comments have double hash tags '##'. Commands to be executed are bare:
ls -alt

##  I recommend first attempting this within a virtualbox to get your feet wet.
##  BTW there's a little trick that allows you to copy and paste from
##  another machine or terminal.
##    1) Use a Bridged Adapter in networking options if using a virtual machine
##    2) Find the ip address of the archiso system:  ip addr  // for example mine is 192.168.0.103
##    3) Create a passwd for root: passwd root
##    4) enable sshd:  systemctl restart sshd
##    5) now from your outside machine or terminal, ssh into the archiso system:
##        ssh -l root 192.168.0.103


## So let's get to the meat of it, shall we?

## The first several commands in the Arch Installation guide are not needed for users
## living in the United States and who speak English and use US keyboards:
ls /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz | less # lists all the keyboard keymaps.
loadkeys us  # this is the default.


## The only reason to do this command is to see if your computer uses uefi.
ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars


## This command *should* be done:
timedatectl set-ntp true


## Partitioning...
##   this command lists disks available for partitioning.
fdisk -l


##   This command actually begins to partition your drive
fdisk /dev/sda

##  fdisk important commands: m is menu; p is for print; n for new partition;
##  w is for write and exit.  t is for type of partition.  82 is Linux Swap
##  a is toggle boot for a partition
##  fdisk is pretty easy once you get the hang of it. basically press n for new
##  partition and then follow the dialog.  Dont play around with the offsets.
##  Your biggest concern is sizes of the partitions you want.

##  Generally I use roughly 700MB for /dev/sda1 which will be later on be the
##  /mnt/boot partition.  Then I add 2gb for /dev/sda2 which will later be made
##  swap.  Roughly 50gb for /dev/sda3 for the / partition is more than enough
##  if not using a window manager then I also added roughly 50gb for /dev/sda4
##  because I often build a LinuxFromScratch system there.

##  On my system I have 4 primary partitions with no logical partitions.
##  You could experiment here and make the last partition an  extended partiion
##  which would allow for further partitioning.  But lets just keep it simple...

##  Now make the file systems on your /dev/sda partitions...
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3
mkswap /dev/sda2

##  if you have a fourth partition:
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda4

##  These command should be done in this order:
mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
mkdir /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
swapon /dev/sda2

##  If you have a fourth partiion
mount /dev/sda4 /mnt/lfs

##  pacstrap is basically an initial installation manager where the linux system
##  will be created on /mnt   Other packages can be added here like...
##  grub git sudo openssh.
pacstrap /mnt linux linux-firmware base sudo openssh grub

## Create an fstab for the new system
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

## edit /mnt/etc/fstab if needed.
## 'blkid' can be used as a reference.

................................................................................
## AFTER the NEXT COMMAND the /mnt partition is the / (root) of the system!
................................................................................
arch-chroot /mnt

##  Adjust to your city and adjust the system to the system clock
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/<YourRegion>/<YourCity> /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc

##  It's easy to forget that this new system may not have all the tools you may
##  be used to, so install an editor and other essentials along the way.
##  I like vim or neovim.
pacman -Sy vim neovim nano


##  List whats on the new system. Do you have a bootloader like grub?
pacman -Q | less


##  Add your favorite tools...
pacman -Sy grub openssh gcc bison python make cmake patch m4
pacman -Sy btrfs-progs sudo virtualbox-guest-utils


##  Edit: /etc/locale.gen by removing the hash comments for the language you
##   intend to use.  For English speakers of the US, uncomment en_US.UTF-8
vim /etc/locale.gen


## then execute...
locale-gen


## Give a name to your new system:
echo "mycomputername" > /etc/hostname


##  Samba is used for MS Windows connectivity in the same way you connect to
##  other machines on your Windows network: \\myotherlaptop\
##  on your network.  Check out my "smb.conf" for a very easy configuration.
pacman -Sy samba


##  I prefer Grub as the boot loader. Execute these commands: (sda has no number)
grub-install /dev/sda
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg


##  Networking - so you're up and running when you reboot...
##  Make and edit this file:
vim /etc/systemd/network/10-enp0s3.network
##  use my "10.enp0s3.network" in configuration_files as an example.

##  Btw, The exact title is not very important. However the file name shoud start
##  with a number and include a description of the device and then end with
##  DOT network.


##  These commands will enable networking and sshd at boot assuming you have
##  configured and installed them.
systemctl enable systemd-networkd
systemctl enable systemd-resolved
systemctl enable sshd


## If you plan to use samba:
systemctl enable smb nmb


##  IF you have installed reflector to find the fastest mirrors near you;
##  enter this command... (however, I think they're deprecating reflector... so your mileage may vary.)
reflector --latest 40 --protocol http --protocol https --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist


##  DO NOT forget to give your root a password!:
passwd root

# Now exit the chroot shell:
exit


##  Power off or reboot the system:
##  It's Ok to reboot at this point. Depending on how well you configured the
##  network... you may even have networking!
systemctl poweroff


##  OR if you put hard drive first in the system boot order
systemctl reboot


## TROUBLESHOOTING ##
##  Test the rebooted system... Can you
ping www.Google.com ??

##  If yes, you are good to go!! Congratutalations!
##  If not... we need to troubleshoot!
ping localhost  # (... does that even work?)
ip addr  #  (... are you getting an address?)


##  Enter this command if you get nothing.
##  The device might be slighly different for your set up.
ip link set dev enp0s3 up


## These three commands will start networking at boot
systemctl enable systemd-networkd
systemctl enable systemd-resolved
systemctl enable sshd


## Start a stopped service...
systemctl start systemd-networkd
systemctl start systemd-resolved
systemctl start sshd


## Restart services...
systemctl restart systemd-networkd
systemctl restart systemd-resolved
systemctl restart sshd


##  Remember you can always change the boot order. So if you messed up like
##  forgetting to give yourself the root password (like I have) you can:
##  remount the file systems,  arch-chroot /mnt and then do a: passwd root

##  Happy Computing ... Enjoy your new arch system.
